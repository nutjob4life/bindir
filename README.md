# üè° A Home `bin` Directory

This is my own `bin` directory, which once used the Stupid Buildout Trick‚Ñ¢ of turning your home `bin` directory into a [Buildout](https://pypi.org/project/zc.buildout/1.5.2/#install-egg-based-scripts). No sane person does this in practice, hence my sobriquet "nutjob4life".

And I've since just made it a plain directory that's populated with some hand-cobbled scripts and symlinks to various useful Python tools from my [Python Junk Drawer](https://github.com/nutjob4life/python).
